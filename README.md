# Customised-Linear-Data-Structures-Library
This is a library created by me to explore various linear data structures. 
As it is a generic library, it can be used for any of the data types.

The code is written by implementing object oriented programming.
There is a class for each linear data structure i.e LinkedList(Linear(Singly,Doubly) , Circular(Singly,Doubly)) , Stack, Queue

LinkedList contains functions like InsertFirst, InsertLast, DeleteFirst, DeleteLast, DeleteAtPos, InsertAtPos
The function names are chosen so as they can be self-explanatory.

For further application, if you want to create a Data Structure of a particular requirement, you can create a structure as per application or simply edit the existing one.
